You can chain any number of them by adding commas, like for example: `5 x10, 54 x2, 87 x1` would spawn 10 Serpent Lords (id 5), 2 Castellans (id 54) and 1 Demonbred (id 87).

You can chain any number of them by adding commas, like for example: `1 x50, 18 x50` would spawn 50 Logrian Slingers (id 1) and 50 Militias (id 18). .
